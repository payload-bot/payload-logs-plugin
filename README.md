## Description

SourceMod plugin to allow sending logs.tf previews to a Discord channel through the Payload API.

Current version: 1.2.0

## Requirements

- Sourcemod and Metamod
- SteamWorks and logstf .inc files (included in releases)

## Installation

1. Grab the latest release from the release page and unzip it in your sourcemod folder.
1. Restart the server, or type `sm plugins load payload-webhook` in the console to load the plugin.
1. [Grab your webhook token](https://payload.tf/settings)
1. Set the convar `sm_payload_token` to the token gained above

You're set! You should now recieve logs.tf previews when logs.tf uploads a log successfully.

If you wish to disable the previews, you can set the `sm_payload_send` convar to `0`. To test that the webhook works, you may use the command `sm_payload_test`.
